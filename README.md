# 💧 DANBI

DANBI, an application that helps to manage my family water intake.


## Introduction

DANBI is a service designed for family members who need water intake information.

Moisture is the most basic necessary factor for human to maintain life. Drinking less water increases the risk of exposure to various diseases. Nevertheless, the percentage of 'sufficient water intake' decreases every year, and 6 out of 10 people are reported not drinking enough water. Therefore, we planned this service using applications and NUGU AI speakers.

This service is not just for humans, but also allows to manage the supply of pets and plants together. 

In modern society, the form of family composition is changing. More and more people have pets and plants, and unlike before, they have begun to regard them as family members. As a result, people became more interested in their health care as family members.

The water intake of pets and plants is also directly related to their life support. In the case of pets, diseases can occur if water intake is not performed properly. In addition, in the case of plants, if the cells do not have enough water, they become malnourished and cannot support their weight. Therefore, we have developed a DANBI that helps manage moisture in humans, pets, and plants, that is, all of our families.

Like welcome rain that falls on dry land, our DANBI will provide essential water intake information for humans, pets, and plants in our busy modern society.
